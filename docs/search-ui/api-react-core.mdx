The `SearchProvider` is a React wrapper around the Headless Core, and makes state and actions available to Search UI
and in a React [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), and also via a
[Render Prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

It looks like this:

```jsx
import { SearchProvider, SearchBox } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";
import AppSearchAPIConnector from "@elastic/search-ui-app-search-connector";

const connector = new AppSearchAPIConnector({
  searchKey: "search-371auk61r2bwqtdzocdgutmg",
  engineName: "search-ui-examples",
  endpointBase: "http://my-app-search-host:3002"
});

const configurationOptions = {
  apiConnector: connector,
  searchQuery: { ... },
  autocompleteQuery: { ... },
  hasA11yNotifications: true,
  a11yNotificationMessages: {
    searchResults: ({ start, end, totalResults, searchTerm }) =>
      `Searching for "${searchTerm}". Showing ${start} to ${end} results out of ${totalResults}.`
  },
  alwaysSearchOnInitialLoad: true
};

const App = () => (
  <SearchProvider config={configurationOptions}>
    <div className="App">
      <SearchBox />
    </div>
  </SearchProvider>
);
```

### Context

The "Context" is a flattened object containing, as keys, all <DocLink id="api-state" text="State" /> and <DocLink id="api-actions" text="Actions" />.

We refer to it as "Context" because it is implemented with a [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

ex.

```js
{
  resultsPerPage: 10, // Request State
  setResultsPerPage: () => {}, // Action
  current: 1, // Request State
  setCurrent: () => {}, // Action
  error: '', // Response State
  isLoading: false, // Response State
  totalResults: 1000, // Response State
  ...
}
```

### Initial State

This is useful for defaulting a search term, sort, etc.

Example

```js
  initialState: { searchTerm: "test", resultsPerPage: 40 }
```

See <DocLink id="api-state" section="RequestState" text="Request State" /> for more properties that can be set in initial state.

## Component HOCs

If you wish to use Search UI and build your own custom component, you will need to use our HOCs to use Search UI's core state and actions.

There are two HOCs for accessing Search UI's state & actions, `withSearch` and
`WithSearch`. They use the [HOC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) and
[Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) patterns, respectively. The two methods
are similar, and choosing between the two is mostly personal preference.

Both methods expose a `mapContextToProps` function which allows you to pick which state and actions
from context you need to work with.

### mapContextToProps

`mapContextToProps` allows you to pick which state and actions
from Context you need to work with. `withSearch` and `WithSearch` both use [React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent),
and will only re-render when the picked state has changed.

| name    | type   | description         |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| context | Object | The current Context |
| props   | Object | The current props   |

ex.:

```jsx
import { withSearch } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

const Component = ({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm }) => {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={(e) => {

    }}
    <input type="text" value={searchTerm}>
  )
}

// Selects `searchTerm` and `setSearchTerm` for use in Component
withSearch(({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm }) => ({
  searchTerm,
  setSearchTerm
}))(Component);

// Uses current `props` to conditionally modify context
withSearch(({ searchTerm }, { someProp }) => ({
  searchTerm: someProp ? "" : searchTerm
}))(Component);
```

### withSearch

This is the [HOC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) approach to working with the
core.

This is typically used for creating your own Components.

See [Build Your Own Component](#build-your-own-component).

### WithSearch

This is the [Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) approach to working with the core.

One use case for that would be to render a "loading" indicator any time the application is fetching data.

For example:

```jsx
import { WithSearch } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

<SearchProvider config={config}>
  <WithSearch mapContextToProps={({ isLoading }) => ({ isLoading })}>
    {({ isLoading }) => (
      <div className="App">
        {isLoading && <div>I'm loading now</div>}
        {!isLoading && (
          <Layout
            header={<SearchBox />}
            bodyContent={<Results titleField="title" urlField="nps_link" />}
          />
        )}
      </div>
    )}
  </WithSearch>
</SearchProvider>;
```
